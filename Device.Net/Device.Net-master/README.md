**Version 4 is going to be a big version. Control Transfers are [almost there](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/pull/165)! Check out the [plan](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/projects/11). Many enhancements including Reactive support, standard [`ILogger`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) throughout, are already done and I'm in the middle of testing with more real devices with real apps. The framework is currently getting a thrashing with an app I'm working on. Pull Requests are super welcome!**

**Cross platform C# framework for talking to connected devices such as Usb, Serial Port and Hid devices.**

This framework provides a common Task based Async interface across platforms and device types. This allows for dependency injection so that different types of devices can be used on any platform with the same code. The supported device types are Hid, Serial Port, and USB. Other device types such as Bluetooth and so on may be added in future. Hid.Net is specifically for Hid devices that may be Usb devices. Usb.Net is specifically for Usb devices that don't have a Hid interface. Please visit the [documentation page](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/wiki). Would you you like to [contribute?](https://christianfindlay.com/2019/04/28/calling-all-c-crypto-developers/)

### Currently supports:

| Platform | Device Types |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| .NET Framework     | Hid, USB, Serial Port |
| .NET Core      | Hid, USB, Serial Port  |
| Android | USB |
| UWP | Hid, USB   |
| Linux, MacOS* | [USB (Via LibUsbDotNet)](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/wiki/Linux-and-MacOS-Support)  |

## [Quick Start](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/wiki/Quick-Start)

**Important! Before trying this code, see the above Quick Start**

Example Code:
```cs
public async Task InitializeTrezorAsync()
{
    //Register the factories for creating Usb devices. This only needs to be done once.
    WindowsUsbDeviceFactory.Register(Logger, Tracer);
    WindowsHidDeviceFactory.Register(Logger, Tracer);

    //Define the types of devices to search for. This particular device can be connected to via USB, or Hid
    var deviceDefinitions = new List<FilterDeviceDefinition>
    {
        new FilterDeviceDefinition{ DeviceType= DeviceType.Hid, VendorId= 0x534C, ProductId=0x0001, Label="Trezor One Firmware 1.6.x" },
        new FilterDeviceDefinition{ DeviceType= DeviceType.Usb, VendorId= 0x1209, ProductId=0x53C1, Label="Trezor One Firmware 1.7.x" },
        new FilterDeviceDefinition{ DeviceType= DeviceType.Usb, VendorId= 0x1209, ProductId=0x53C0, Label="Model T" }
    };

    //Get the first available device and connect to it
    var devices = await DeviceManager.Current.GetDevicesAsync(deviceDefinitions);
    var trezorDevice = devices.FirstOrDefault();
    await trezorDevice.InitializeAsync();

    //Create a buffer with 3 bytes (initialize)
    var buffer = new byte[64];
    buffer[0] = 0x3f;
    buffer[1] = 0x23;
    buffer[2] = 0x23;

    //Write the data to the device and wait for the response
    var readBuffer = await trezorDevice.WriteAndReadAsync(buffer);
}
```

## Store App Production Usage

**Hardfolio** - Cryptocurrency portfolio app for hardwarewallets. Hid.Net started its life as a project inside the Hardfolio app codebase. The original aim of this app was to support multiple hardwarewallets across multiple platforms. It turned out that Hid.Net and Usb.Net were warranted as libraries in their own right because there really is not other library on the internet that supports all the platforms that were needed for Hardfolio.
